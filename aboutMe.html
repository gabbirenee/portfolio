                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>My name is Gabbi Forsythe. I grew up in Brownsburg, Indiana and graduated from Bethesda Christian High School in 2017. Growing up, I loved playing video games with my brother, watching the Apple Keynotes, and reading about all the new technology. This love of tech inspired me to study Software Engineering at Butler University.</p>
                <p>After I graduate college in May 2020, I am looking forward to getting a Software Developer position in Indianapolis. My dream is to help build software that I believe in. Software is an important part of our society and I want to use my skills in Software Development to make a difference in the world. On top of developing software, I want to teach a high school computer science class. I believe that Computer Science is an important field of study for everyone, not just those that are interested in Computer Science. By teaching a high school class, I hope to help students try something new and share my passion for computer science.</p>
                <p>When I'm not coding, I enjoy reading, playing piano, and helping out at my church. I am also very involved on campus at Butler. The biggest student organization that I am a part of is the Student Government Association (SGA). I love working on the SGA website and think it is a great way to be involved in everything that is happening on campus. Another event that I love being involved in is Bulldogs Into the Streets (BITS). BITS is the annual service day that Butler puts on to serve the Indianapolis Community. I have participated in BITS as both a volunteer and a site leader. It is an event that I look forward to every year. Other organizations that I am a part of include PAVE, CRU, and Upsilon Pi Epsilon (Computer Science Honor Society). </p>
