                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>Hi, my name is Gabbi Forsythe and I am an aspiring software developer from Brownsburg, Indiana. I graduated from Bethesda Christian High School in 2017. Growing up, I spent a lot of time playing video games with my brother, watching the Apple Keynotes, and reading up on all the newest technology. All these nerdy hobbies are what eventually lead me to study Software Engineering at Butler University.</p>
                <p>In May 2020, I will graduate from Butler with a Bachelor’s Degree in Software Engineering and a minor in Spanish. I am looking forward to getting a job as a Software Developer in Indianapolis. Software is an important part of our society and I want to use my skills to help build software that makes a difference in the world. In the future, I want to use my programming knowledge to invest in others. Teaching a high school computer science would allow me to invest in the lives of students and share my passion for computer science with them.</p>
                <p>When I’m not coding, I enjoy reading, playing piano and ukulele, and volunteering at my church. I also love being involved in different organizations around campus. Whether it’s working on the Student Government Association’s website, volunteering with Bulldogs Into the Streets and Pave, or attending CRU events there is always something to be doing on campus. While all these activities are great, there is nothing better than cheering on the Bulldogs at the basketball games.</p>
