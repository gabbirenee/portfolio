                    <h2>SmarterHQ: Tech Services Intern</h2>
                    <h4>May 2019 - August 2019</h4>
                    <p><a href="https://smarterhq.com/" target="_blank">SmarterHQ</a> is a digital marketing company located in Indianapolis, Indiana. During my time there as the Tech Services Intern, I worked with many different teams in the company to build the companyâ€™s Knowledge Base. Building this Knowledge Base benefitted the company by creating one central place for information that can be accessed by anyone in the company, increasing visibility across the company. This process also involved redesigning the look of Knowledge Base (hosted on Zendesk) to increase the usability. I also audited the implementation of our software for a variety of customers. I ensured that the correct data was being collected and that the data that was being collected was clean. <br /> <b>Note: </b> I received this internship as a part of the <a href="https://techpoint.org/xtern/" target="_blank">Xtern program</a>, hosted by Techpoint.</p>

                    <p>As the Website Coordinator for Butler University's <a href="https://sga.butler.edu/" target="_blank">Student Government Association (SGA)</a>, I work with the directors of the various boards to figure out what information should be displayed on our website.
